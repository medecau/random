archival of random code artefacts

# read me!

the code in here may be:
- dangerous to you, your system, or bank account
- buggy, unfinished, inefficient, rotten, or useless

# why this?

- script hoarding
- reference trials
- share ideas

## script hoarding
the main reason for this repository is that commiting the code here reduces my anxiety over losing it

some of the code was brought in, from backup storage or other locations, long after being written in the first place, sometimes years later.
